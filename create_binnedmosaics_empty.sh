  echo "    The script creates binned mosaic images from individual chip FITS"
  echo "    files of a multi-chip instrument. The mosaic must be 'regualrly'"
  echo "    shaped, i. e. the mosaic must form a rectangle with each chip"
  echo "    having the SAME x- and y-dimensions. If this is not the case"
  echo "    you have to rpovide an own, instrument dependent version of this"
  echo "    script."
  echo "    The created image mosaics allow us an easy"
  echo "    evaluation of prereduction quality and a comfortable detection of"
  echo "    image defects that might need manual intervention."
  echo ""
  echo "    The script takes its input images from /main_dir/science_dir/,"
  echo "    creates a subdirectory BINNED and puts its results therein."
  echo ""
  echo "    Given that individual chip FITS files have names like"
  echo "    prefix*_'CHIPNUMBER'image_extension.fits (The '*' stands"
  echo "    for an arbitrary character string) the output images"
  echo "    get the names prefix*.fits"

  echo ""
  echo "    This bins all images in /aibn85_2/terben/DATA/SCIENCE_R"
  echo "    with names WFI*_'CHIP'OFCSF.fits, where 'CHIPS' stands "
  echo "    for numbers ranging from 1 to the number of chips for"
