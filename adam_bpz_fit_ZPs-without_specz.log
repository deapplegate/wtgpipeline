PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATION TESTS
If the dmag are large, add them to the .columns file (zp_offset), then re-run BPZ.
(For better results, first re-run with -ONLY_TYPE yes to fit SEDs to known spec-z.)

fo/ft = Average f_obs/f_model weighted by f_obs/ef_obs for objects with ODDS >= 0.95
dmag = magnitude offset which should be applied (added) to the photometry (zp_offset)
nobj = # of galaxies considered in that filter (detected and high ODDS >= 0.95)
