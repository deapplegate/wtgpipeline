# The third argument now contains the "."
# before the fits extension. This prevents that
# empty strings have to be given as third argument
# (what made problem if this script was called
# within another script)

# 15.03.2004:
# if a link points again to a link, it is simply
# deleted and NO files are removed. To keep a consistent
# structure, first a pass is made through all
# the data and double links (and those pointing to
# nowhere) are deleted before
# the real deletion process starts.

# tempaorary files go to a TEMPDIR directory 

# $1: master directory
# $2: prefix of files
# $3: ending "OFCSFF etc.". Files end with _i$3fits
#     where i is the chip number
#     The ending contains the "." before the fits
#     extension.
