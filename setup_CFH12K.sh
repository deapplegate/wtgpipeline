# The script creates a CFH12K.ini file according
# to the date of the run under consideration.
# The CFH12K camera changed its setup several times
# between 1999 and 2002.
# We assume for the moment that all images in
# the run require the same initialisation.
#
# We consider right now setups for the periods:
# 24/03/1999 (GABODSID 82)  - 02/11/1999 (GABODSID 305)
# 02/11/1999 (GABODSID 305) - 28/05/2000 (GABODSID 514)
# 28/05/2000 (GABODSID 514) - ........
#
# Important dates checked:
# - 480564o.fits (24/03/1999) has march 1999 setup
# - 504141o.fits (01/10/1999) has march 1999 setup
# - 508034o.fits (02/11/1999) has november 1999 setup
# - 532346o.fits (06/05/2000) has november 1999 setup 
# - 532882o.fits (10/05/2000) has november 1999 setup 
# - 534693o.fits (24/05/2000) has november 1999 setup
# - 534850o.fits (25/05/2000) has november 1999 setup
# - 535038o.fits (26/05/2000) has november 1999 setup
# - 535302o.fits (28/05/2000) has 'incorrect' june 2000 setup
#   The CRPIX1 value of the 4th extension has the wrong sign!!
# - 535847o.fits (01/06/2000) has 'incorrect' june 2000 setup
# - 539885o.fits (01/07/2000) has 'correct' june 2000 setup
# - 565625o.fits (01/01/2001) has june 2000 setup
# - 591827o.fits (16/06/2001) has june 2000 setup
# - 623835o.fits (03/02/2002) has june 2000 setup
# 
# Note that the above periods reflect periods
# from data we analysed. They probably do NOT
# mark the dates when setup changes  have been
# actually done. This holds for the transition of
# the 03/1999 to the 11/1999 period. The second change
# is located accurately. 
#
# The script has to be called in your reduce directory
# and it needs the following files:
# CFH12K.ini.raw, cfh12k_03_1999.ini, cfh12k_11_1999.ini and
# cfh12k_06_2000.ini.
#
# $1: directory from which to read the first image
#     to obtain the observation date (We use the
#     MJD-OBS keyword)
