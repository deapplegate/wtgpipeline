# script to select N 'best' frames.
# Best is defined here as distance from
# the mean of the modes from all images.
# The script is mainly intended to select frames
# if reduction is done with eclipse tools and
# hence disk swapping with too many frames 
# should be avoided.
#
# the NFRAMES variable has to be defined in the
# instrument configuration file !!!!!!

# 14.04.2005:
# I rewrote the script to use the imcat based 'imstats'
# instead of the FLIPS-based 'immode' for statistic
# estimation on FITS files.

# 14.08.2005:
# - The call of the UNIX 'find' program is now done
#   via a variable 'P_FIND'.
# - The call of the UNIX 'sort' program is now done
#   via a variable 'P_SORT'.
#
# 09.09.2005:
# I corrected a bug in the FIND command. We need to
# test regular files and links, not only regular files.
