# Description:         Performs sky subtraction of FITS images
#                      obtained in optical wavelengths
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Script history information:
# 24.09.2007:
# Script started (significant rewrite from an old script)
#
# 26.09.2007:
# - update of documentation
# - more robust treatment for a wrong skysubtraction mode
# - The subtraction modes are called ONEPASS and TWOPASS now
#
# 28.09.2007:
# - I corrected bugs in the deletion of temporary files
# - I test whether maindir/sciencedir exists at all
#
# 19.10.2007:
# The special cleanTmpFiles function (arguments) 
# for this script required
# a rearrangement of the trap function handling program 
# interruption.

# File inclusions:
. ${INSTRUMENT:?}.ini > /tmp/sub.out 2>&1

# define various variables because of the '-u' script flag
# (the use of undefined variables will be treated as errors!)
# several variables might be used uninitialised 
# in the cleanTmpFiles function.

  echo ""
  echo "        The large detection minarea together with a low threshold"

  echo "    If it shows large scale gradients or fringe residuals it will give"
  echo "    very wrong results and spoil photometric measurements later on."
  echo "    Image imperfections might errorneously be identified as objects"
  echo "    and wrongly be masked in the first pass or the calculated mode for"
  echo "    the whole image is not a good estimate for the whole image which"
  echo "    leads to a wrong background subtraction in the second pass.  "
