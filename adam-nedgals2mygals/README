match_specz_and_bpz_cats.py: this was supposed to make a catalog with Zspecs that could be read into bpz, but now it seems to me that such a catalog is worthwhile so that I can analyze how effective the bpz photoz's are, but passing it into bpz.py is not necessary. So what I should do instead is finalize this thing to write out a catalog, then, starting from some of the other adam_match_nedgals2mygals*.py codes which do a lot of plotting, plot things to evaluate the effectiveness of bpz.py and don't worry about adding a Z_S column to the bpz.py input cat. bpz doesn't learn from specz's in the way that I wish it would, so there is no use in doing this.

adam_do_multiple_photoz.py and adam_do_photometry.py: no longer have to be adapted to do this stuff, just comment out the changes I made.
