# this script performs astrometry by using astrometrix 

# 23.05.2003:
# added the functionality of 'rename_astrometrixhead.sh'
# to this script
#
# 14.06.2003:
# update of the script to work with version 1.1b of
# the WIFIX package
#
# 23.01.2004:
# we now use the same catalogs as in the singleastrom
# script here in the 'initk' astrometrix step.
# The LDAC catalogs from singleastrom are just linked
# to the appropiate place and hence they do not need to
# be recreated here.
#
# 28.01.2004:
# the links from the original singleastrom cats are
# now removed at the end of the script. Otherwise
# these catalogs are moved if links are resolved at
# a later stage.
#
# 21.03.2004:
# I set the lintol parameter in the initk step to 10 arcsec.
# (This solved a 'no overlap with standard stars' problem
# in one of the sets) 
#
# 06.04.2004:
# - fixed a bug for deleting the links in astrom/$2
#   directory. To be able to do this we have to change
#   to the astrom directory after copying and renaming
#   the headers
# - I changed back the value of the lintol parameter.
#   The problems arised when running astrometrix
#   on several runs simultaneously. This is now
#   done correctly within the create_astrometrix_run.sh
#   script. 
#
# 30.05.04:
# tempaorary files go to a TEMPDIR directory 
#
# 22.08.2007:
# The executable of SExtractor is set to 'sex_theli' as
# it is called now within the THELI pipeline.

# $1: main dir.
# $2: science dir. (the cat dir is a subdirectory of this)
# $3: extension
